# Challenge6

This week we were challenged to create a weather application dashboard.

When the application was loaded up the user would be able to:

* Search for a city
* Be presented with that current cities current weather conditions
* City name would be visible as well as weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index
* When you view the future weather conditions, the termperature and humidity is shown
* When you click on a city in the search history you are presented with that cities current a future weather conditions
Screenshot for the application is below:
